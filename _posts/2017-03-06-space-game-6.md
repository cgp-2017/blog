# Space Game - Session 6

## Keeping Score

Let's add score to the game! 
- It's a way to compare how well you are doing
- you can add consequences if you reach a certain amount of points
  - tougher enemies appear
  - you could go to the next level
  
## Adding A Scene Behaviour

- On the dashboard, choose `Create New` from the top left corner
- Switch to `Behaviour`
- Select `Scene Behaviour`
- Enter "Display Score" as the name

## Adding a Font

## How do you get score?

Right now the score is displayed, but it's always zero.

Let's add points **everytime you kill an enemy!**

Which behaviour should we add this to? 
- The behaviour that kills the bullet!
  - (which one was that again?)
    - The **Bullet Movement** behaviour
    
Let's take another look at it:

We need to add a new line right there in that `if statement`

To increase the `Score` attribute, we need to go to the `Game attributes` tab in the  `Attributes` section.

- Drag in the `set score to ____` block
- Click on the little triangle in the field and add an `Addition` block from the `Math` section
- Drag the `score` block from the `Game attributes` tab into the left field in the Addition block
- Enter "1" into the right field

Test it!
