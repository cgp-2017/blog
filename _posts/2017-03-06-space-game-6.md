# Space Game - Session 6

## Keeping Score

Let's add score to the game! 
- It's a way to compare how well you are doing
- you can add consequences if you reach a certain amount of points
  - tougher enemies appear
  - you could go to the next level
  
## Adding a Font

- On the dashboard, choose `Create New` from the top left corner
- Switch to the `Font` tab
- Enter "Score Font" as the name
- Click `Create`

This will take you to the font editor. 
- Play around with the properties until you like the result
- Keep in mind the font should be **visible against the background**


  
## Adding A Scene Behaviour

- On the dashboard, choose `Create New` from the top left corner
- Switch to `Behaviour`
- Select `Scene Behaviour`
- Enter "Display Score" as the name

### Writing the Code

- the `Event` should be **When Drawing**
  - in `Basics`
- In the `Drawing` section of the Palette:
  - under **Style**
    - Drag in the `set current font to [Font]` block
    - Choose your "Score Font" as [Font]
  - under **Drawing**
    - Drag in the `draw text [___] at (x:[__] and y:[__])` block
    - enter "10" as both `x` and `y` coordinate

### Creating a GAME ATTRIBUTE
A Game Attribute is an attribute that you can use in your whole game not just in one behaviour.
- Why do we need that?
- Because we want to 
  - Display the Score (in a Scene Behaviour)
  - Change the Score (in a Actor Behaviour)
  
Let's do it:

- Open the `Attributes` section in the Palette
- Click on "Create New Game Attribute"

A pop-up window appears. Enter the indicated values and click "OK".

The new Game Attribute should be added to the `Game Attributes` tab:

- Drag in the `Score` block into the empty text field of your code.


Your code should look like this:
NOTE: I added an additional step to make it look nicer in game. (If you want to you can find the `[__] & [__]` block under `Text`.

**Don't forget to add the behaviour to your Scene!**
NOTE: If you have more than one sene you need to add the behaviour to every single one!

## How do you get score?

Right now the score is displayed, but it's always zero.

Let's add points **everytime you kill an enemy!**

Which behaviour should we add this to? 
- The behaviour that kills the bullet!
  - (which one was that again?)
    - The **Bullet Movement** behaviour
    
Let's take another look at it:

We need to add a new line right there in that `if statement`

To increase the `Score` attribute, we need to go to the `Game attributes` tab in the  `Attributes` section.

- Drag in the `set score to ____` block
- Click on the little triangle in the field and add an `Addition` block from the `Math` section
- Drag the `score` block from the `Game attributes` tab into the left field in the Addition block
- Enter "1" into the right field

Test it!

Did you notice something?
**The score doesn't reset when you die!**

To fix this let's go to the behaviour that handles **dying and reloading**:
  ==> the `ASTEROID MOVEMENT` behaviour
  
- In the `Collision` event
  - add a `Set Score to [__]` block
  - enter "0" into the empty field
