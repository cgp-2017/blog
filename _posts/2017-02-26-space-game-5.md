### STEP 3: Add a "WHEN UPDATING" event

1. Add an `if` block to the `when updating`
2. Click on the triangle. Remember from a few weeks ago? Find the `OR` block with two blanks
3. Click on the triangle on the __left blank__. Find the `<` with two blanks and add it
4. In the left most blank, click on the triangle again and add __X OF ACTOR__. Set `actor` to `self`.
5. Set the blank to the right of `<` to 0.
6. On the right side, click on the triangle and find `>`
7. On the left side, click on the triangle and add another __X OF ACTOR__. Set `actor` to `self`.
8. On the right side, click on the triangle and add `screen width`
9. Inside the `if`, add a `SET X SPEED` block.
10. Click on the triangle in the value, and set it to `NEGATE`
11. Click on the triangle, and set the value to `X-SPEED of ACTOR`. Set `actor` to `self`.

Everything should look like this in the end:

### STEP 4: Attach to an enemy and test!

## Your enemy

Now it's time for YOU to come up with an enemy movment.

Here's some ideas:

- Make it move in circles
- Make it move towards you
- Make it teleport randomly
