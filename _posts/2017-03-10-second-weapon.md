# Second Weapon

In this session, you'll add a second gun to your arsenal. If you finish, you'll be able to add more weapons easily.

## STEP 1: Find a new gun.

Grab a new gun from the Asset Store. You can open the asset store from the "Window" menu at the top of the screen.

I went with the shotgun ðŸ”«

Remember to import it.

## STEP 2: Add a new sound for your second gun

Download a free sound for your gun. I went with a shotgun sound:

## STEP 3: Place the gun on your player

Open up your `FirstPersonCharacter` inside your `FPSController` and add the gun next to your other one:

## STEP 4: Gun Position

Rotate the new gun so it looks like you're holding it.

Looks kinda weird with both there, though....

## STEP 5: Hide the new fun

Select the new gun, and in the inspector, disable your new gun.
