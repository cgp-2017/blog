# Space Game - Session 4

Right now, all you can do is dodge the asteroids. Now we will add the ability to shoot back!

## Step 1 - Create a bullet actor type

- Create a new **Actor Type**
 
- choose a fitting sprite (e.g. x, x, x)

- check that the collision box fits properly

- set up the **Physics**
  - **not** affected by gravity
  - **doesn't** rotate
  - **can** move

- make a new **Collision Group** called "Projectiles"

- assign that **Collision Group** in the **Properties** tab


## Step 2 - Spawn bullet

This behaviour will be **attached to the Player** and will spawn a bullet **right in front of the player** when you press the "Shoot" button.



## Step 3 - Bullet behaviour

This behaviour will be **attached to the Bullet**. It will
- make it move upwards **when** the bullet is **created** 

- it **always checks** if it leaves the screen:
  - kill the bullet

- if it **COLLIDES WITH** a member of the **Enemy Group**:
  - kill the enemy
  - kill the bullet
  

Either **try to do it yourself with the plan above**, or just follow the detailed instructions below!


### Bullet Behaviour Walk-Through
- Create a new **Actor Behaviour** called "Bullet Behaviour"


#### To make the bullet move
- Add a ``When Creating`` event
- Set the `y-speed` for `self` to `100`

#### To destroy the bullet when it leaves the screen
- Add a `When Updating` event
- add an `if` block
  - put a `____ = ____` block as the condition
    - put `y of self` in the first field
    - put a `negate` block in the second field
      - put a `height of self` block in the `negate` block
  - inside the `if` block put `kill self`

#### To kill an Enemy if you hit it

- Add a `Collisons` > `Any Actor collides with...` > `Member of Group` event
  - change the `Actor` to `self`
  - change `Actor Group` to `Enemies`
- add two `kill __` blocks
  - set one to `kill self`
  - drag [SCREENSHOT] into second one

**Don't forget to add the behaviour to the bullet and test your game!**
