# Space Game — Session 1

## Create New Game

- “Click Here to Create New Game”
  	- Choose: “Blank Game”
- Basic Info:
    - Enter a name.
    - Suggestion: [Your name] Space Game
- Screen Size:
    - Width: 480 px
    - Height: 640 px

## Download Resources:

- Go to your browser
- Enter:
    - bit.ly/cgp-space
- Click (No thanks, continue to view) if it prompts you to log into Dropbox
- Download and click on it once after it downloaded to unzip the folder.
- Check that there is a folder named “SPACE” and open it. (Keep it open; you will need it in the next steps.)

## Create a New Background:

- On the Dashbord look for
    - BACKGROUND
- Click on “This game contains no background. Click here to create one.”
- Enter a name (make it descriptive!)
- “Click here to add a frame”
- The rest should be familiar!

## Create a Scene with that Background

- Look inside the downloaded folder and choose a background you like.
- On the Dashboard look for
     - SCENES
- Click on “This game contains no scenes. Click here to create one.”
     - Give it a name (suggestion: Level 1)
     - Don’t change anything else! (Color is not necessary, since we are using a background image)
- In the lower right corner you will find this:

     - Click on the + and choose “New Background Layer”
     - Choose your background!

## Create your Character

- Look inside the downloaded folder and choose a ship (or other character) that you like. Please note that if there is more than one picture in the image file that means that the sprite will be animated.
- Create a new ACTOR TYPE (you should know how by now!), give it a fitting name

APPEARANCE:
    - Add one animation with at least one frame

BEHAVIORS/EVENTS:
    - Empty

COLLISION:
    - Check that the collision box fits your character properly!

PHYSICS:
    - No rotation,
    - Should there be gravity? (HINT: we’re in space!)

PROPERTIES:
    - Choose correct group

## Make it move!

- A Blank Game in Stencyl comes with basic controls, but you should still check that they are there and that you like the default keys!
- Make a new ACTOR BEHAVIOR:

- The EVENT is “WHEN UPDATING”
- Try to write a behaviour that:
    - IF the LEFT control is pressed, sets the SPEED along the X axis to NEGATIVE 30, OTHERWISE IF the RIGHT control is pressed, sets the SPEED on the same axis to 30
    - And OTHERWISE (= when neither control is pressed) sets the SPEED on this axis to ZERO.
- Add this behavior to your actor and __test__ if you can move! (and if you are going in the right direction!)
- What happens when you leave the screen?

- To prevent this from happening, add another EVENT to your behaviour: WHEN CREATING
    - Just add the block “Make always active”
- Test again! What changed?

## WAH! I’m already done! WHAT DO I DO NOW?!?!

- Relax! And feel proud!
- Try solving these tasks on your own:
    - Add Up-Down-Movement
    - HINT: it works very similarly to Left-right but along a different axes!

    - Add your Enemy ACTOR TYPE

	    HINT: Choose an sprite from our folder, give it a fitting name
	    HINT 2: You will need a new COLLISION GROUP

    - Add a Behaviour that makes the Enemy simply move down

    - If you don’t like the our sprite or background options, find your own!

		  HINT: make sure the image is not too big or too small! (sprite should be about 50x50 pixels, background about 480x640)

		  HINT 2: adding “sprite” or “background” to your search phrase can help a lot!

    - Prevent the PLAYER from leaving the screen
