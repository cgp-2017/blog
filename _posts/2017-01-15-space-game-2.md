# Space Game — Session 2

We've made our hero ship in space, now we make our enemies.

## A trick on the eyes

In our game, we are bravely moving forward through space:

In our game, we need to shoot and dodge asteroids we fly by.

__QUESTION__: How do we make it look like we're going forward but we keep the
ship at the bottom of the screen?

__ANSWER__: We make the asteroids fly downwards!

This way, we trick the player's eyes into thinking we're going forward.

## What are we doing?

A small list:

1. New actor group for enemies
2. `Asteroid` actor
3. `Asteroid movement` behavior

Before we start...

## How does movement work in Stencyl?

Look at this screenshot again:

![](http://i.imgur.com/L7Usdak.png)

Our ship in this game has two coordinates for its position:

- __X__: The number of pixels from the left of the screen.
- __Y__: The number of pixels from the top of the screen.

In this screenshot, our ship has the following coordinates: (423, 678).

An actor in Stencyl has two features: An `x-speed` and a `y-speed`.

Let's look at `x-speed` first:

### `x-speed`

A POSITIVE `x-speed` means that the X coordinate of the actor will INCREASE
every time the game has an update. This will make it look to the player as if
the actor is moving to the RIGHT.

A NEGATIVE `x-speed` means that the X coordinate of the actor will DECREASE
every time the game has an update. This will make it look to the player as if
the actor is moving to the LEFT.

### `y-speed`

A POSITIVE `y-speed` means that the Y coordinate of the actor will INCREASE
every time the game has an update. This will make it look to the player as if
the actor is moving DOWN.

A NEGATIVE `y-speed` means that the Y coordinate of the actor will DECREASE
every time the game has an update. This will make it look to the player as if
the actor is moving UP.

### Summary

For future reference, let's say we have a speed of 50:

- `x-speed = 50` means that we go RIGHT
- `x-speed = -50` means that we go LEFT
- `y-speed = 50` means that we go DOWN
- `y-speed = -50` means that we go UP

## Let's get to work

## STEP 1: Actor group for Enemies

Rememember how to do this?

__QUESTION__: What should the `enemies` group be called?

__QUESTION__: What should `enemies` collide with?

## STEP 2: `Asteroid` actor

By now you should know what we need:

1. Pick a graphic from the `space` folder you [downloaded](bit.ly/cgp-space) last week (Or your own. Make sure it's 100 by 100 pixels)
2. Dashboard -> Actor Types
3. "Click here to create a new Actor type"
4. Give it a name like `asteroid`. Something that makes sense. Click `Create` to confirm.
5. Add animations as you've done a few times now.
6. Open the `collisions` tab and check that all's good
7. Open the `physics` tab.
    - QUESTION: Should movement be normal?
    - QUESTION: Can it rotate?
    - QUESTION: Affected by gravity? (HINT: There's a very minimal gravity effect in space)
8. Open the `properties` tab. Make sure we have the correct actor group

## STEP 3: `Asteroid movement` behavior

1. Dashboard -> Actor Behaviors
2. Click here to create a new behavior
3. Call it something like `asteroid movement`. Something that makes sense to YOU. Click `Create` to confirm.
4. As always:

### what event do we need?

Let's think. When the asteroid is CREATED, then we want to start it moving. Sounds pretty BASIC.

Inside this event, we need two blocks:

1. Make *Self* always active
2. Set *X/Y SPEED* to *NUMBER*

Um.

__QUESTION__ What should we set here?

Do we want to set X speed or Y speed? Should it be POSITIVE or NEGATIVE? What NUMBER is good? I think something like 30 is good.

We want to move DOWN.

__ANSWER__: You got this!

Once you've figured it out. TEST IT. Place an asteroid on the scene! See if it moves down!

### What happens when an asteroid bumps into the ship?

Right now, they just bump and it looks funny!

Let's make it so that the player loses when this happens.

We're going to ADD AN EVENT to the SAME BEHAVIOR.

### What event do we need now?

Sounds like we need a COLLISION. Specifically, when it crashes into a MEMBER OF GROUP.

1. Kill *Actor of Group* (Drag `Actor of Group` from the event block into that value)
2. Reload and `Fade Out` for `0.5` seconds using `black` and `Fade in` for `0.3` seconds using `black`.

As always TEST YOUR WORK. We should be able to die now.

## Now what?

- That's all for now! Good job!
- Try solving these tasks on your own:
    - Add Up-Down-Movement
    - HINT: it works very similarly to Left-right but along a different axes!
    - Prevent the PLAYER from leaving the screen (HINT: How big are the coordinates?)
