# Space Game — Session 2

We've made our hero ship in space, now we make our enemies.

## A trick on the eyes

In our game, we are bravely moving forward through space:

In our game, we need to shoot and doge asteroids we fly by.

__QUESTION__: How do we make it look like we're going forward but we keep the
ship at the bottom of the screen?

__ANSWER__: We make the asteroids fly downwards!

This way, we trick the player's eyes into thinking we're going forward.

## What are we doing?

A small list:

1. New actor group for enemies
2. `Asteroid` actor
3. `Asteroid movement` behavior
4. `Death by collision` behavior

Before we start...

## How does movement work in Stencyl?

Look at this screenshot again:

Our ship in this game has two coordinates for its position:

- __X__: The number of pixels from the left of the screen.
- __Y__: The number of pixels from the top of the screen.

In this screenshot, our ship has the following coordinates: (423, 678).

An actor in Stencyl has two features: An `x-speed` and a `y-speed`.

Let's look at `x-speed` first:

### `x-speed`

A POSITIVE `x-speed` means that the X coordinate of the actor will INCREASE
every time the game has an update. This will make it look to the player as if
the actor is moving to the RIGHT.

A NEGATIVE `x-speed` means that the X coordinate of the actor will DECREASE
every time the game has an update. This will make it look to the player as if
the actor is moving to the LEFT.

### `y-speed`

A POSITIVE `y-speed` means that the Y coordinate of the actor will INCREASE
every time the game has an update. This will make it look to the player as if
the actor is moving DOWN.

A NEGATIVE `y-speed` means that the Y coordinate of the actor will DECREASE
every time the game has an update. This will make it look to the player as if
the actor is moving UP.

### Summary

For future reference, let's say we have a speed of 50:

- `x-speed` = 50 means that we go RIGHT
- `x-speed` = -50 means that we go LEFT
- `y-speed` = 50 means that we go DOWN
- `y-speed` = -50 means that we go UP
