# Space Game - Session 4

Right now, all you can do is dodge the asteroids. Now we will add the ability to shoot back!

## Step 1 - Create a bullet actor type

- Create a new **Actor Type**
 
- choose a fitting sprite (download some [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r9h5d5rvqo2svc6/bullets.zip?dl=0))

- check that the collision box fits properly

- set up the **Physics**
  - **not** affected by gravity
  - **doesn't** rotate
  - **can** move

- make a new **Collision Group** called "Projectiles" by clicking on "Edit Groups..."

- assign that **Collision Group** in the **Properties** tab


## Step 2 - Spawn bullet

This behaviour will be **attached to the Player** and will spawn a bullet **right in front of the player** when you press the "Shoot" button.

- Add a **Keyboard Control** for shooting
  - `Settings` > `Controls`
  - Add a new **Control** called "Shoot" and pick a button
  
- create a new **Actor Behaviour** called "Spawn Bullet"

- add a `Input` > `Keyboard` event
  - set it to `when **shoot** is **pressed**`
  - add a `create ____ at (x: ____ y: ____) at Front` block
    - Choose Actor Type `Bullet`
    - put a `___ - ____` block in the x field
      - put a `x of self` block into the field, and change it to `x-center`
      - to get the value you substract from `x-center of self`, open your **Bullet Actor Type**
        - in the **Collision** tab, you find its **Width**
      - enter **Half the Width** into the second field
    - put a `x of self` block into the y field 
      - change it to `y of self`
 
 These were some confusing calculations, check out the graphic below:

## Step 3 - Bullet behaviour

This behaviour will be **attached to the Bullet**. It will
- make it move upwards **when** the bullet is **created** 

- it **always**:
  - kills the bullet when it leaves the screen

- if it **COLLIDES WITH** a member of the **Enemy Group**:
  - kill the enemy
  - kill the bullet
  

Either **try to do it yourself with the plan above**, or just follow the detailed instructions below!


### Bullet Behaviour Walk-Through
- Create a new **Actor Behaviour** called "Bullet Behaviour"


#### To make the bullet move
- Add a `When Creating` event
- Set the `y-speed` for `self` to `-100`

#### To destroy the bullet when it leaves the screen
- Add a `When Updating` event
- add an `kill self after leaving screen ` block

#### To kill an Enemy if you hit it

- Add a `Collisons` > `Any Actor collides with...` > `Member of Group` event
  - change the `Actor` to `self`
  - change `Actor Group` to `Enemies`
- add two `kill __` blocks
  - set one to `kill self`
  - drag ![](http://i.imgur.com/1KvIrOq.png) into second one

**Don't forget to add the behaviour to the bullet and test your game!**
