# Player Health

Now let's have some health for our player.


## STEP 1: Create an instance of the health bar

We'll have our own instance of the health bar prefab we made a few weeks ago. Drag it into the canvas:

MAKE SURE IT'S INSIDE THE CANVAS

## STEP 2: Make sure the health bar is visible in the screen

- Move the X and Y position so that the health bar is visible in the game view.
- Make sure the health bar is anchored to the top left. You've done this before.

__RUN THE GAME__. It should show the health bar, but NOT DECREASE IT. We'll do that now.
